# WPF C# Tutorial â€“ Create Snipe the dummies, a sniper scope shooter game in visual studio
Welcome to this new tutorial from MOO ICT. In this tutorial we will create a fun and exciting new game called Snipe The Dummies a WPF and C# sniper shooter game all made inside of visual studio. This was a very fun project to make and I couldn't wait to share it everyone when it was working. 

I this project you will create a simple game where you control a sniper Scope using the mouse and you can click on your target to interact with it. The dummy images i am using in this game will change its position on the map randomly and they are set to variable speed when the game loads. This tutorial will also show you how to make use of the custom functions inside of C# so you can make it work exactly the way you want to. We will use 2 different timers in this tutorial. One will control the Dummies and another one will control the ghost that will fly away after you have successfully clicked on a dummy in the map. 

You can see how much you score and how many dummies you missed on the game in real time too. We have got both of the labels linked to the timer and they update the scores and miss text as the player interacts with the game. 

I hope this tutorials is useful for you and happy programming. 

Moo Out.
